/**
 * Monaco language-service web workers for the squisq demo site.
 *
 * The `?worker` imports are Vite-specific, so this bundler-facing glue lives
 * in the app (not in the tsup-built editor-react library). squisq owns the
 * label→worker mapping via configureMonacoWorkers; we just supply the five
 * constructors. Imported for side effect from main.tsx before the app mounts.
